# Yo, awesome human! 🙌🏾 I'm mal! 👋🏾☺️

Welcome to my digital workshop, where ideas get brewed and brought to life! For two decades, I was out there mastering the art of the deal, wrangling projects, and even making technical documents sound... well, less technical. But lately, I've traded my corporate cape for a coding keyboard, diving headfirst into the exhilarating world of **full-stack web and app development.** It's like finding a brand new level in a game I've been playing my whole life.

### My Origin Story (or, "Who Am I, Really?") 🚀🫣

Ever met someone who can talk fiber optics and responsive design in the same breath without breaking a sweat? That's me! I've always been the person who thrives on untangling knots, whether it's a complex client problem or a particularly stubborn bug in the code. My unique blend of B2B and B2C battlefield experience means I'm not just building apps; I'm crafting solutions that genuinely connect with people. Think of me as your friendly neighborhood problem-solver, now powered by JavaScript and Python!

### My Digital Toys & Talents 🛠️

My toolkit is a bit like my brain: constantly learning, adapting, and picking up new shiny things. Right now, I'm having a blast with:

* **Code Speak:** JavaScript, Python, Node.js, PHP, HTML, CSS (and yes, a tip of the hat to VBA for old times' sake – we all have our humble beginnings!).
* **Data Whisperers:** MongoDB, MySQL (because every digital story needs a solid memory).
* **Creative Crew:** Adobe Premiere, Photoshop, XD, After Effects, Acrobat – because sometimes, code needs a little visual flair.
* **Automation Obsession:** Seriously, I'm hooked on making workflows smarter with tools like n8n. Efficiency is my middle name (well, not really, but it *could* be!).

### Beyond the Code: Future-Forward & Fun 🧠💡

My curiosity meter is always pegged to "high," especially when it comes to tomorrow's tech. **AI** makes my brain tingle, particularly getting cozy with **local LLMs via Ollama**. It's like having a super-smart buddy right on my machine! And if there's a microchip and a blinking LED involved, count me in for an **IoT, ESP, Raspberry Pi, or Arduino** adventure. Merging tried-and-true methods with cutting-edge innovations? That's where the real magic happens.

When I'm not lost in a sea of code or a new tech rabbit hole, you'll probably find me:

* Yelling "Heja BVB!" at a **Borussia Dortmund** game ⚽ (my heart bleeds yellow and black!).
* Grooving to some awesome **music** 🎶.
* Chasing the perfect light with my **camera** 📸.
* Or, you know, flying my **drone** ✈️ (sometimes just for a bird's-eye view of my perpetually messy garden).

### Let's Cook Up Something Cool (Together)! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏾

Got an idea brewing? Want to geek out over AI, share some coding tips, or just chat about the beautiful game or the best drone spots? My inbox is open! I truly believe that the coolest stuff happens when we **connect and share what we know to help each other grow**. I'm always up for learning something new, collaborating on exciting projects, and being part of a team that enjoys the journey as much as the destination. Let's make the digital world a little bit better, one shared byte at a time!
