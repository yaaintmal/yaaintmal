Hey there, code explorer! 👋 I'm mal.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I'm brewing up some digital magic! After two decades navigating the wild seas of sales, project management, and making documentation actually readable (yes, it's possible!), I've decided to swap spreadsheets for JavaScript and project plans for code commits. Think of me as a seasoned professional who found a new favorite puzzle: full-stack web and app development.
Who Am I? 🚀

I'm that person who can talk B2B, B2C, and fiber optic infrastructure one minute, and then deep dive into responsive design the next. My superpower? Untangling complex problems, making sense of technical jargon for actual humans, and guiding projects from a fleeting idea to a fully functional reality. Now, I'm channeling all that seasoned problem-solving, client whispering, and project orchestration into building dynamic, user-centric applications. Why? Because bringing ideas to life with code is just plain cool.
My Digital Playground 🛠️

You know, they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Good thing I'm more of a tech-curious chameleon! My current toolbox looks a bit like this:

    Languages & Frameworks: JavaScript, Python, Node.js, PHP, HTML, CSS, and a nostalgic nod to VBA (we all start somewhere, right?).

    Databases: MongoDB, MySQL (because data loves a good home).

    Creative Suite: Adobe Premiere, Photoshop, XD, After Effects, Acrobat (when visuals speak louder than code).

    Automation Alchemist: Heavily into workflow automation with tools like n8n – because who doesn't love making things happen with less effort?

Future-Forward & Fun 🧠💡

My brain runs on curiosity, especially when it comes to what's next. I'm utterly fascinated by the world of AI, particularly local LLMs with Ollama (because running smart things on my own machine feels like living in the future). And if it has wires and can blink, I'm probably trying to make it smarter – hello IoT, ESP projects, Raspberry Pis, and Arduinos! Combining classic wisdom with cutting-edge tech? That's the sweet spot.

When I'm not debugging or dreaming up the next big app, you can find me:

    Cheering (or nervously pacing) for Borussia Dortmund ⚽ - Heja BVB!

    Lost in the rhythm of good music 🎶.

    Capturing moments through photography 📸.

    Taking to the skies with my drone ✈️ (sometimes just to check if my roof needs cleaning).

Let's Connect! 🤝

Got a cool idea? Want to chat about the future of tech, football, or the best drone shots? Hit me up! I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to a team that values innovation and a good chuckle.
